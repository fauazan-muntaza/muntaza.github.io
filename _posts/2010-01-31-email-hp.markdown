# Bismillah,

The story of the email experience in my Handphone...

Email using the gmail application on Nokia 2330 Mobile dependable enough. Can send and receive emails directly to the Mobile. Way, Open the browser built into the Nokia 2330, Opera Mini 4.1, go to the site m.gmail.com, and then will appear the words "Get Faster Gmail" click there, then download the gmail application, and install.

To use: Open the Gmail application on => Applications-> Games-> Gmail.
